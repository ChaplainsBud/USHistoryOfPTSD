"America" beheaded a chief in war: 

"America has been involved in wars large and small since before the founding of the nation. The first such war, sometimes called Metacomâ€™s Rebellion or King Philip's War, lasted 14 months and destroyed 14 towns.
The war, tiny by today's standards, ended when Metacom (the Pokunoket chief called "King Philip" by the English), was beheaded."
